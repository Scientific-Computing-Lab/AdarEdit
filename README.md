AdarEdit: A Graph Foundation Model for Interpretable A-to-I RNA Editing Prediction

AdarEdit is a domain-specialized graph foundation model for predicting A-to-I RNA editing sites. Unlike generic foundation models that treat RNA as linear sequences, AdarEdit represents RNA segments as graphs where nucleotides are nodes connected by both sequential and base-pairing edges, enabling the model to learn biologically meaningful sequence–structure patterns.
